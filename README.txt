TIPS
====

We cannot afford to offer no-cost technical support.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to us via a github issue. We can't 
guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in future 
versions.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding: 
Tai Le Mong Kawng does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. If you 
cannot use the built-in keyboards of the operating system, you should 
install the appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the 
language you wish to use. You will need to install the appropriate keyboard and 
input method for the characters of the language you wish to use.
